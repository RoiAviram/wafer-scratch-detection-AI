# 📊 Wafer Scratch Detection using AI-Based Classification

This project focuses on detecting surface scratches on semiconductor wafers using **machine learning classification models**, aiming to improve **yield quality** and reduce **production costs** in the semiconductor industry.

## 🧠 Project Summary

The assignment uses real-world wafer inspection data to train and evaluate binary classifiers that predict whether a wafer die is scratched or not.  
By applying **AI techniques** such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**, the model supports **automated quality assurance** and minimizes the need for manual inspection.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (classification models & evaluation tools)

## 📈 Key Insight

> 🟢 After experimenting with Random Forest, I selected **Logistic Regression** for its comparable recall with significantly faster runtime.  
> 🧠 This model can be used in real-time inline inspection systems to **reduce production costs** by:
> - Minimizing false positives (good dies marked as defective)
> - Enhancing throughput via automation  
> - Reducing dependency on manual inspection
